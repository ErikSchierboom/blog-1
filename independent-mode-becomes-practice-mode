Exercism tracks can be solved in two ways:
1. A focus on learning a new language, where you are guided by mentors and work through a structured set of exercises. We call this Mentored Mode.
2. A focus on practicing a language, choosing whichever exercises look most interesting, and only reaching out to mentors for help when required. We've called this Independent Mode.

As of today, we are renaming "Independent Mode" to "Practice Mode" to better reflect its intention. 
In Practice Mode you're not alone - you can still reach out to a mentor and get help when needed, but the focus in on working at your own pace and practicing a language, not learning it from scratch.

In the future we may rename "Mentored Mode" too, but we'll defer that for later.
