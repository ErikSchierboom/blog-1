Our community are currently working hard on Exercism v3. We're making great progress but the downside is that a lot of time is being diverted away from mentoring.

I made a [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiV_vYn1Ea8) to explain and ask for your patience during this period.

Thanks for your understanding and support!
