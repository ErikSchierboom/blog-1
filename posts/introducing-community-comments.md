Last year we relaunched Exercism with a new focus around more formal mentoring. As part of that change we disabled the ability for the wider community to comment on each others solutions. The logic for that was a desire to keep the learning experience in more private, safe spaces, and avoid random unsolicited comments from strangers.

I'm now happy to announce that we've reintroduced community comments on solutions. Our rational for this is that others' solutions provide a valuable learning opportunity, and we want to give people the ability to ask questions about ideas or techniques they see in solutions. We actively don't want this to be a second-stage of public mentoring, and as such we've added a notice to remind commenters of the purpose of the box:

We also know that many users do **not** want others to be able to comment on their solutions. They might still want to make them public, but don't want the extra interactions, or the "messiness" of having others' thoughts on their showcased work. We've therefore added an option to turn commenting on or off per solution, which can be accessed through the "Manage Public Solutions" option on your profile. To make this quicker, we've added a global option to set a default for new solutions. Next time you log in, you'll see a modal asking you what you would like to set your default to:

We hope you'll get lots of enjoyment and use from this new feature, and benefit from learning from others' work. If you run into any problems with this, please open a report on our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/exercism/exercism). Thanks!
